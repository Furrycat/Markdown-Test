Automated Oligo Design Pipeline
===============================

The Automated Oligoneucleotide Design Pipeline extracts signature oligoneucliotides of specified lengths primarily 
using the progrom SigOli (Signature Oligo, Manuel Zahariev). 
Using these outputs from taxon groups of interest, they can be used to identify species with great accuracy.
